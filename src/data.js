    description:
      "For my degree project, I designed and developed a fully interactive VR environment in Unity for Oculus Rift. I implemented two types of visual cues: subtle (particle effects) and emphasized (highlighting) to explore how variations in color and transparency influence player immersion and task performance. \n\nThe project involved creating a structured user study, where participants interacted with cues in different configurations (three colors and two transparency levels). Beyond building the VR application, I gained valuable experience in designing interaction systems, optimizing for VR performance and integrating research-driven design variables into gameplay mechanics. \n\nIn addition to development, I also managed the research process end-to-end: planning and structuring user tests, recruiting participants and collecting data. This project strengthened my skills in development, user-centered design, and experimental evaluation, while giving me practical insight into how design choices impact player experience.",

This project gave me hands-on experience in coding in Unity and using Oculus Rift for user studies. \n\nWe created two scenes in Unity, one simple with few objects and one complex with more ojects. The users where then tasked to find three objects in the scene by looking at them.",
